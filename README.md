# Hand-Cabinet interaction

## Description

This repository contains the code for the hand-cabinet interaction.

## Usage

### Installing from scratch

#### Using venv

Run the following command to install the dependencies:
Open terminal and type:

```
python3 -m venv ./cabinet
source ./cabinet/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Or using Conda

```
conda env create -f label.yml
```

### Folder structure

Here's a folder structure for the project:

```
MCSCabinet/     # Root directory.
├── stage_1.sh # Runs corner and bounding box annotation tool, then runs heatmap generation code.
├── annotate_corners_v1.1.py/        # Code used to annotate corenrs of cabinet
├── bbox_annotation_using_points.py/          # Code used to annotate bounding box in top view
├── heatmap_v3.py/       # Detects interation and generates heatmap
├──./run.sh # runs correction pipeline
├── jog_v3.py
├── Import_Cabinets_Data.rb # ruby file for importing data
├── README.md
├── label.yml # env file for conda use: conda env create -f label.yml
├── mock_cabinet.png
├── requirements.txt # requirements file for virtual env
├── run.sh

### Setup generic data

Edit the *metadata.yml* file to set configuration data:

```yml
---
title: My document title
author: Ralph Huwiler
rights:  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
language: en-US
tags: [document, my-document, etc]
abstract: |
  Your summary text.
---
```

You can find the list of all available keys on [this page](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block).

### Creating chapters

Creating a new chapter is as simple as creating a new markdown file in the *src/* folder; you'll end up with something like this:

```
src/01-introduction.md
src/02-installation.md
src/03-usage.md
src/04-references.md
```

Pandoc and Make will join them automatically ordered by name; that's why the numeric prefixes are being used.

All you need to specify for each chapter at least one title:

```md
# Introduction

This is the first paragraph of the introduction chapter.

## First

This is the first subsection.

## Second

This is the second subsection.
```

Each title (*#*) will represent a chapter, while each subtitle (*##*) will represent a chapter's section. You can use as many levels of sections as markdown supports.

#### Links between chapters

Anchor links can be used to link chapters within the document:

```md
// src/01-introduction.md
# Introduction

For more information, check the [Usage] chapter.

// src/02-installation.md
# Usage

...
```

If you want to rename the reference, use this syntax:

```md
For more information, check [this](#usage) chapter.
```

Anchor names should be downcased, and spaces, colons, semicolons... should be replaced with hyphens. Instead of `Chapter title: A new era`, you have: `#chapter-title-a-new-era`.

#### Links between sections

It's the same as anchor links:

```md
# Introduction

## First

For more information, check the [Second] section.

## Second

...
```

Or, with al alternative name:

```md
For more information, check [this](#second) section.
```

### Inserting objects

Text. That's cool. What about images and tables?

#### Insert an image

Use Markdown syntax to insert an image with a caption:

```md
![A cool seagull.](images/seagull.png)
```

Pandoc will automatically convert the image into a figure (image + caption).

If you want to resize the image, you may use this syntax, available in Pandoc 1.16:

```md
![A cool seagull.](images/seagull.png){ width=50% height=50% }
```

Also, to reference an image, use LaTeX labels:

```md
Please, admire the gloriousnes of Figure \ref{seagull_image}.

![A cool seagull.\label{seagull_image}](images/seagull.png)
```

#### Insert a table

Use markdown table, and use the `Table: <Your table description>` syntax to add a caption:

```md
| Index | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 0     | AAA  |
| 1     | BBB  |
| ...   | ...  |

Table: This is an example table.
```

If you want to reference a table, use LaTeX labels:

```md
Please, check Table /ref{example_table}.

| Index | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 0     | AAA  |
| 1     | BBB  |
| ...   | ...  |

Table: This is an example table.\label{example_table}
```

#### Insert an equation

Wrap a LaTeX math equation between `$` delimiters for inline (tiny) formulas:

```md
This, $\mu = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \frac{x_i}{N}$, the mean equation, ...
```

Pandoc will transform them automatically into images using online services.

If you want to center the equation instead of inlining it, use double `$$` delimiters:

```md
$$\mu = \sum_{i=0}^{N} \frac{x_i}{N}$$
```

[Here](https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)'s an online equation editor.

### Output

This template uses *Makefile* to automatize the building process. Instead of using the *pandoc cli util*, we're going to use some *make* commands.

#### Export to PDF

Use this command:

```sh
make pdf
```

The generated file will be placed in *build/pdf*.

Please, note that PDF file generation requires some extra dependencies (~ 800 MB):

```sh
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra 
```

#### Export to EPUB

Use this command:

```sh
make epub
```

The generated file will be placed in *build/epub*.

#### Export to HTML

Use this command:

```sh
make html
```

The generated file(s) will be placed in *build/html*.
